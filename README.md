# 4chan-Scraper-Qt
Web scraper with single objective.

## Objective
Challenge project taken by rolling dice and doing what the dice told us to do. Initially started by https://github.com/AAmcall and most of the back-end was made by him. I started to help with libcurl related bugfixing and ended up writing the Qt front-end.
